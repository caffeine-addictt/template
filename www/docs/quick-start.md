# Quick Start

In this example, we will create a sample project.

## Example

Run the `new` command and answer the prompts to create a new project:

```sh
waku new
```

That's it!

Waku has just created a new project for you,
with everything you need to get started;
CI, CD, Makefiles, CoC, and more!

If you find Waku's official styles to be too generic for your use case,
you can very easily create your own reusable styles! Check out our
[documentation](./configuration/introduction.md) to get started.
