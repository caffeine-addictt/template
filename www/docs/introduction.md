# Introduction

Waku is a project generation tool for developers.

## Why we made it?

Waku was created to alleviate the pains of setting up new projects.

Over time, developers end up creating personal boilerplate projects
that still require tedious customization before any meaningful code
can be written. Waku streamlines this process, providing ready-made
templates with minimal setup, so you can focus on what matters from
day one.

Waku aims to reduce the time and effort required to get your projects
from **conception to production**.

## Use cases

Waku is built with extensibility in mind â€” you can choose from a
plethora of styles or even create your own!

Whether you're building a microservice in Go, setting up a React
front-end, or managing a full-stack project, Waku provides templates
and tools to get started quickly.

## Usage

You can simply run `waku new` and follow the prompts to get started.
